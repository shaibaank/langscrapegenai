- Explain why this topic is significant
- Outline the key areas that will be covered in the summary

## CORE INSIGHTS
- Identify and summarize key concepts, methods, and applications related to the topic
- Condense detailed information into digestible insights
- Highlight the most important findings from the sources
- Use bullet points for clarity when appropriate

## GAPS & CHALLENGES
- Analyze the collected data to identify what's missing or unresolved in the field
- Highlight ongoing debates or research challenges that remain open
- Discuss limitations in current understanding or methodologies

## VIEWPOINTS
- Compare different perspectives from the sources
- Identify any contradictions, overlaps, or consensus between them
- Present balanced information that shows the full spectrum of opinions
- Note any evolving perspectives or changing consensus

## PROJECT IDEAS
- Offer 3-5 feasible, actionable project proposals related to the topic
- Suggest further questions or research directions that could lead to new discoveries
- Provide specific starting points or methodological approaches for each idea

Format each section with clear headings, concise paragraphs, and use bullet points where appropriate. Write in a formal, academic tone.`;
